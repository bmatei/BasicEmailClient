A possible command for building this project would be:
javac -d build -cp libs/javax.mail.jar:libs/jsoup-1.8.1.jar:. src/emailclient/*.java

Beware that building a project in an IDE and building it manually may have different
results many times because IDE's have a habbit of adding their own convenient options
to the compiler (like -g or -Xlint:none for instance)
